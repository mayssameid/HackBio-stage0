The Color Scale Problem in Genomics Nobody Talks About:
Color plays a central role in genomic data visualization, especially in heatmaps and expression plots. However, poor color choices can easily mislead interpretation and exclude parts of the scientific audience.
In genomics, color is often treated as an aesthetic detail rather than a scientific decision, which creates serious problems.

Rainbow color scales are a common example. Although visually appealing, they are perceptually misleading, creating artificial boundaries and exaggerating differences that do not reflect true biological variation.

Colorblindness is another frequently ignored factor. Many figures rely on red–green contrasts to show up- and down-regulation, making them difficult or impossible to interpret for individuals with color vision deficiencies. 
This reduces accessibility for reviewers, collaborators, and clinicians with color blindness, weakening the effectiveness of scientific communication.

Misleading gradients also contribute to misinterpretation when color scales lack a meaningful reference point or exaggerate minor expression changes. 
Without careful design, color can distort both the magnitude and direction of biological effects.
